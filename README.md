- 👋 Hi, I’m @RevRastaPasta
- 👀 Data Analysis, R Language, Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and AWS cloud technologies.
- 🌱 Currently learning more about R, Python, Power BI, and trying to get my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification.
- 💞️ Trying to collaborate on more data analysis projects, if you've got a data set that I can work, let me know for sure, would love more and more real-life scenarios and projects.
